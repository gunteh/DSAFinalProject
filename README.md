Welcome to the Department Store Management System GitHub repository! This project includes advanced data structures and algorithms to a department store management system. The key features:

## Features

### Binary Search Tree (BST) for Inventory Management
- **Efficient Search and Modification**: With a BST at the helm, inventory management becomes a breeze, enabling quick search and modification operations.
- **Sorted Structure**: Each product seamlessly integrates into the BST as a node, ensuring an always-sorted and in-order traversal for efficient sorting by key.

### Priority Queue for Online Orders
- **Convenient Ordering**: Customers can effortlessly place orders via a user-friendly menu interface.
- **Priority-Based Processing**: Online orders are intelligently prioritized based on urgency: pick-up orders take precedence, followed by next-day deliveries, and then standard orders.
- **Streamlined Fulfillment**: A dedicated button allows for the immediate fulfillment of the next order, seamlessly deducting it from the in-store inventory.

### Hash Table for Customer Loyalty Rewards
- **Efficient Lookup**: Leveraging a Hash Table, our system provides swift access to customer loyalty rewards information.
- **Personalized Rewards**: Customers can enjoy personalized rewards based on their loyalty level, accessed via their phone number.
- **Convenience**: For ease of testing, preset phone numbers are available to access sample loyalty rewards data.
